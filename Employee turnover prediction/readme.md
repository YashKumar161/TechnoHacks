Description:
This project predicts employee turnover using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can identify employees who are most likely to leave the company based on various features such as age, business travel, daily rate, department, etc. The Random Forest classifier is used to train the model, and performance metrics such as accuracy score and classification report are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

Files:
- main.py: Python script containing the code for preprocessing the data, training the Random Forest classifier, evaluating the model's performance, and making predictions for new data.
- dataset.csv: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- README.md: This document providing information about the project.

Dependencies:
- pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
  Installation: pip install pandas
- scikit-learn: Python library for machine learning algorithms and tools.
  Installation: pip install scikit-learn

Usage:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using the provided commands.
3. Place the dataset.csv file in the same directory as the main.py script.
4. Run the main.py script to preprocess the data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions for new data.
5. View the calculated performance metrics (accuracy score, classification report) to assess the model's accuracy.
6. Modify the 'new_data' dictionary in the main.py script to make predictions for new employee data.
