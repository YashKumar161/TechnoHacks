Description:
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc., which are used to train a model to predict the price of a house. The Random Forest Regressor algorithm is used for training the model, and performance metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) are calculated to evaluate the model's accuracy.

Files:
- main.py: Python script containing the code for preprocessing the data, training the Random Forest Regressor, evaluating the model's performance, and making predictions for new house prices.
- dataset.csv: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- README.txt: This document providing information about the project.

Dependencies:
- pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
  Installation: pip install pandas
- scikit-learn: Python library for machine learning algorithms and tools.
  Installation: pip install scikit-learn

Usage:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using the provided commands.
3. Place the dataset.csv file in the same directory as the main.py script.
4. Run the main.py script to preprocess the data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions for new house prices.
5. View the calculated performance metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE) to assess the model's accuracy.
