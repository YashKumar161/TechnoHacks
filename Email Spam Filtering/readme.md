Description:
This project implements an email spam filtering system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam). The dataset contains email text along with their corresponding labels (spam or ham). The project utilizes the Naive Bayes classifier and TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction from the email text. Performance metrics such as accuracy score and classification report are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

Files:
- main.py: Python script containing the code for preprocessing the data, training the Naive Bayes classifier, evaluating the model's performance, and making predictions for new email data.
- dataset.csv: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- README.md: This document providing information about the project.

Dependencies:
- pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
  Installation: pip install pandas
- scikit-learn: Python library for machine learning algorithms and tools.
  Installation: pip install scikit-learn

Usage:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using the provided commands.
3. Place the dataset.csv file in the same directory as the main.py script.
4. Run the main.py script to preprocess the data, train the Naive Bayes classifier, evaluate its performance, and make predictions for new email data.
5. View the calculated performance metrics (accuracy score, classification report) to assess the model's accuracy.
6. Modify the 'new_data' dictionary in the main.py script to make predictions for new email data.
